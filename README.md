# Comparing-KNMI-LENTIS-to-ERA5


### Unit conversion 
* The KNMI LENTIS data for the precipitation is in the unit units: kg m-2 s-1 which has to be converted to mm/day to make it comparable
* 1 kg of water over 1 square meter (kg m-2) is equivalent to 1 mm of water depth and there are 86400 seconds in a day.  Thus, multiply the precipitation rate in kg m-2 s-2 by 86400 to convert it to mm/day.
